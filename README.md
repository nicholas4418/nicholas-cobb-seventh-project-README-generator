# Seventh Project: Node - Professional README Generator

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a README generator using node and Inquirer.
- I worked on this project as a means to familiarize myself with using node as a tool in web development.
- The problem this project solves is that it allows me to better understand how to use node and some node packages, as well as gain experience with the aformentioned tools.
- I have learned that node, and to an extent, Inquirer, are powerful tools that provide developers a wide range possibilites and functionality in web development.

## Installation 
- Run the command "npm install" for installation.
- Run the command "node index.js" to start the program.

## Usage
- This project can be used as a "crash course" of sorts to quickly refresh one's memory on the usage of Node.
- This project can also be used as a legitimate README generator for future projects.
